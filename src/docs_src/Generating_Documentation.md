# Generating Documentation for Propeller

In order to generate documentation, you'll need Python and `pip` installed.

To generate documentation with [codox](https://github.com/weavejester/codox), run `scripts/GenerateDocs.sh` in the command line from the `scripts` directory.
To make the script executable, you may need to first run `chmod +x GenerateDocs.sh`.
This will run "lein codox" on the command line to generate first batch of HTMl files.
Then, it runs FunctionsToMD to take Push instructions generated by `def-instruction` and spit it out to a Markdown file.
Then, it runs HTMLFix to fix the ordered lists in `Adding_Genetic_Operators.md`, `Adding_Problem.md`, and 
`Adding_Selection_Method.md`.
