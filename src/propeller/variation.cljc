# Variation

Propeller includes many kinds of genetic operators to create variation within the population.
You can specify the rate of the variation genetic operators with the `:variation` map.
   
***Some*** of the available genetic operators are described in this documentation. See the code
for others and for details.
   
To add a new genetic operator you must add a case for the operator's keyword in new-individual,
calling existing or new utility functions that should be included earlier in this file.

## Crossover

Crossover genetic operators take two `plushy` representations of Push programs
and exchange genetic material to create a new `plushy`.

| Function                         | Parameters             | Description                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `crossover`                      | `plushy-a` `plushy-b`  | Crosses over two individuals using uniform crossover, one Push instruction at a time. Pads shorter one from the end of the list of instructions.       |
| `tail-aligned-crossover`         | `plushy-a` `plushy-b`  | Crosses over two individuals using uniform crossover, one Push instruction at a time. Pads shorter one from the beginning of the list of instructions. |

## Addition, Deletion, Replacement, Flip

Addition, deletion, replacement, and flip genetic operators take a `plushy` and a rate of occurrence to create a new `plushy`.

| Function                                  | Parameters                                 | Description                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uniform-addition`                        | `plushy` `instructions` `umad-rate`        | Returns a plushy with new instructions possibly added before or after each existing instruction.                                |
| `uniform-replacement`                     | `plushy` `instructions` `replacement-rate` | Returns a plushy with new instructions possibly replacing existing instructions.                                                |
| `uniform-deletion`                        | `plushy` `umad-rate`                       | Randomly deletes instructions from plushy at some rate.                                                                         |

## Uniform Mutation by Addition and Deletion

Uniform Mutation by Addition and Deletion (UMAD) is a uniform mutation operator which
first adds genes with some probability before or after every existing gene and then
deletes random genes from the resulting genome. [It has been found](http://cs.hamilton.edu/~thelmuth/Pubs/2018-GECCO-UMAD.pdf) that UMAD, with relatively
high rates of addition and deletion, results in significant increases
in problem-solving performance on a range of program synthesis
benchmark problems. When you run a problem in Propeller, you can specify the `umad-rate` to determine the frequency
of addition and deletion.

`:umad` in the `:variation` map when running a problem will call `uniform-addition` and `uniform-deletion` with the `umad-rate`.
Since `uniform-addition` and `uniform-deletion` are somewhat stochastic, you can use
`:rumad` to ensure that the actual rates of addition and deletion are equal when mutating a genome.

## New Individual

The function `new-individual` returns a new individual produced by selection and variation of individuals in the population based on the genetic operators provided in the `:variation` map."
